# Open Source Contributions
This repo documents my real PRs and improvements to public projects. Focus: meaningful code, bugfixes, and docs upgrades that help others.

Why bother?
I learned almost everything from open source, and it feels great giving back. Here I track what I fixed, what repo, and why it matters (plus what I learned!).

Plan to add:
- Links and descriptions for each PR/issue addressed; summary of main impact
- Screenshots, code, contributor highlights
